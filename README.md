LTF implements theoretical results developed in [El Aouni, Anass, et al. "A Fourier approach to Lagrangian vortex detection." Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science 29.9 (2019): 093106]. 

The present code provides a fully automated identification of Lagrangian coherent eddies from oceanic currents.

The file agulhas_demo.m shows an example of this procedure applied on geostrophic current over the Southern ocean.

The geostrophic products used here are produced by SSALTO/DUACS and distributed by AVISO: http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/duacs

Tested on matlab 2015b.
